# Grade-Calculator

## Feature I want to implment
* Create some software that handles my grades
* Ability to create class, edit existing classes
* Some system to preserve the data initial data pull, storage in CSV file
* Some sort of fuzzy matching in names and sections
* Gradient that lets you anticipate what grade you need to accomplish a goal (some sort of slider system)

## Issues I Expect to Come:
* How to select between classes (by name, number, ...)
* Tedious initial setup


## Possible Solutions:
* Provide initial information file to analyze, after done analyzing and creating data, move to an old folder

## Programming Language to Use (currently undecided)
* Python rapid development (should have a GUI component involved but unsure how to do in python)
* Java better framework (use javafx, then build the jar file to work properly, personally more familiar with it)
